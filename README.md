# Eyes Game#

## Description: 
This repository contains the JavaScript code and HTML files used to create two eyes on the web browser. The eyes are coded to follow the movement of the mouse as it moves along webpage. Once the mouse leaves the tab, the eyes will remain looking at the direction in which the mouse last was.

## How to Run:
Clone the full repository to reside in a single registry. Load the index.html file to a web browser and move the mouse over the area in the browser to see the eyes follow the mouse's movement. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
You can change the colors of the eyes in the script file. An additional change that can be created is to have the eyes reset to the starting postion.
